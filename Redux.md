### **Redux in React â€“ A State Management Library**
Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with **React** to manage global state. It helps in managing application state in a predictable and centralized way.

---

## **Why Use Redux in React?**
1. **Centralized State Management** â†’ Keeps the app's state in a single place (store).
2. **Predictability** â†’ State updates follow strict rules (reducers).
3. **Easier Debugging** â†’ Time-travel debugging via Redux DevTools.
4. **Component Communication** â†’ Helps pass data between deeply nested components without "prop drilling."
5. **Better Scalability** â†’ Useful in large-scale apps with complex state interactions.

---

## **How Redux Works in React?**
Redux follows a unidirectional data flow:
1. **Store** â†’ Holds the global state.
2. **Actions** â†’ Plain JavaScript objects that describe an event (e.g., "ADD_TODO").
3. **Reducers** â†’ Functions that take the current state and an action, then return a new state.
4. **Dispatch** â†’ Sends an action to update the state.
5. **Selectors** â†’ Extracts specific data from the state.

## **Basic Redux Setup in React**
### **1. Install Redux Toolkit & React-Redux**
```sh
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

---

### **2. Create a Redux Slice (`counterSlice.js`)**
A slice contains the **state, reducers, and actions** for a feature.
```js
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => { state.value += 1; },
    decrement: (state) => { state.value -= 1; }
  }
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

---

### **3. Configure the Redux Store (`store.js`)**
```js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "./counterSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer
  }
});
```

---

### **4. Provide the Store in `main.jsx`**
Wrap your app with `<Provider>` to give components access to Redux.
```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "./store";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>
);
```

---

### **5. Use Redux State in a Component (`Counter.jsx`)**
```jsx
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { increment, decrement } from "./counterSlice";

export default function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div className="text-center mt-10">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button
        className="px-4 py-2 m-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded"
        onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}
      >
        Increment
      </button>
      <button
        className="px-4 py-2 m-2 bg-red-500 text-white rounded"
        onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}
      >
        Decrement
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### **6. Import and Use the Counter Component in `App.jsx`**
```jsx
import Counter from "./Counter";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Counter />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## **Conclusion**
Redux helps manage state in large applications, but for small apps, **React's Context API** or **useState** might be sufficient. **Redux Toolkit (RTK)** simplifies Redux setup, making it the recommended way to use Redux today.
